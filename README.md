# Learning Pathfinding (MonoGame)

This repository is a learning project focused on pathfinding algorithms and how they apply to a 2D game world. The project uses MonoGame to visualize grids, obstacles, and computed paths so the algorithm behavior is easy to see and understand.

## Goals
- Learn and implement pathfinding algorithms (A*, Dijkstra, BFS, etc.)
- Visualize how algorithms explore the grid
- Experiment with grid features like obstacles, weighted tiles, and multiple floors

## What’s Included
- A 2D top‑down grid renderer
- Obstacle editing at runtime
- Start/goal markers
- A* pathfinding with visualization
- Quality‑of‑life controls (grid lines, clear obstacles, legend)

## Controls
- Left click: toggle obstacle
- Right click: set goal
- Middle click: set start
- C: clear obstacles
- G: toggle grid lines

## How to Run
1) Open the solution folder in VS Code
2) Ensure MonoGame is installed
3) Run:
   - `dotnet run`

## Roadmap
See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for completed steps and planned extensions.
